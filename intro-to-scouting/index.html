<h1>Intro to Scouting</h1><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouting">Scouting</a> aims to support young people in their physical, mental and spiritual development, that they may play constructive roles in society, with a strong focus on the outdoors and survival skills.</p><h2>What is Cub Scouting?</h2><p>Cub Scouting is fun! No matter what grade you are in, first through fifth, it can be a blast. Do you like to learn by doing? This is just the place. You can learn to tie knots, set up a tent, or shoot a bow and arrow (archery). Have you ever cooked a meal on a campfire? Sent a secret code to a buddy? Built a birdhouse? Hiked? Earn rewards for doing these things in Cub Scouts.</p><h3>Cub Scouts Belong to Packs and Dens</h3><p>As a Cub Scout, you will be part of your own pack.</p><p>The pack is divided into smaller groups called dens. Each den has about six to eight boys. All of the Cub Scouts in your den are in the same grade and may even go to the same school.</p><p>The Cub Scout pack belongs to a church, a school, or some other group of people in your community or neighborhood. This group makes sure your pack has good adult leaders, a place to meet, and exciting things to do. The group gets help from the Boy Scouts of America, which is part of Scouting around the world.</p><h3>Cub Scouts Do Things and Go Places</h3><p>Have you been to the local police station and talked to the policemen on duty? Or visited the fire station and sat in the driver’s seat of the pumper truck? Or visited the local TV station and sat in the news anchor’s chair? These are some of the places you might go with your den or pack.</p><p>You might also build a pinewood derby car and race it on the track, build a sailboat or trimaran and race it in the raingutter regatta, or build a spaceship and race it to the stars in the pack space derby.</p><h3>Cub Scouts Earn Awards</h3><p>Each time you complete an accomplishment or learn a new skill, you will be rewarded. Sometimes the reward is a loop for your belt, a pin, or a patch. Sometimes it is a smile on your parents’ faces to see you grow and learn.</p><picture>

<p>Webelos dens are for boys who have completed third grade (or reached age 10). Webelos Scouts get to work on the five required Webelos adventures and choose two of the 18 elective adventures that are shared by the Webelos and Arrow of Light ranks.</p><p>When a boy has done the requirements for an adventure, the Webelos den leader, rather than a parent, approves most of the adventures. For each adventure a boy completes, he receives a pin to wear on the Webelos colors or on his hat. After completing seven adventures, including five required adventures and two elective adventures, a Scout can receive the Webelos badge.</p><h3>Arrow of Light</h3><picture>

<p>The highest rank in Cub Scouting is the Arrow of Light. Earning this rank prepares a Webelos Scout to become a Boy Scout. Scouts must complete four required adventures and three elective adventures to earn the Arrow of Light rank. For each adventure a boy completes, he receives a pin to wear on the Webelos colors or on his hat.</p><p>More information:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/CubScouts/UniformsAndAwards/advancement.aspx">Advancement Trail</a></li><li><a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/CubScouts/UniformsAndAwards/sanda.aspx">Scouting Adventures</a></li></ul><h2>The Benefits of Scouting</h2><p>Scouting is unique. It is a movement dedicated to bringing out the best in people. Cub Scouting doesn’t emphasize winning as an end result, but rather the far more demanding task of doing one’s best.</p><p>Scouting helps nurture courage and kindness and allows boys to play, to laugh, to develop their imaginations, and to express their feelings. We want boys to become useful and stable individuals who are aware of their own potential. Helping a boy to learn the value of his own worth is the greatest gift we can give him.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/Parents/About/benefits.aspx">Benefits to Scouting</a> are numerous:</p><ul><li>Cub Scouting Is Fun</li><li>Cub Scouting Has Ideals</li><li>Cub Scouting Strengthens Families</li><li>Cub Scouting Helps Boys Develop Interests and Skills</li><li>Cub Scouting Provides Adventure</li><li>Cub Scouting Has an Advancement Plan</li><li>Cub Scouting Creates Fellowship</li><li>Cub Scouting Promotes Diversity</li><li>Cub Scouting Provides a Year-Round Program</li><li>Cub Scouting Is a Positive Place</li></ul><h2>The Cub Scouting Method</h2><p>The Cub Scouting program has 10 purposes related to the overall mission of the Boy Scouts of America – to build character, learn citizenship, and develop personal fitness:</p><ol><li>Character Development</li><li>Spiritual Growth</li><li>Good Citizenship</li><li>Sportsmanship and Fitness</li><li>Family Understanding</li><li>Respectful Relationships</li><li>Personal Achievement</li><li>Friendly Service</li><li>Fun and Adventure</li><li>Preparation for Boy Scouts</li></ol><p>Every Cub Scouting activity should help fulfill one of these purposes. When considering a new activity, ask which purpose or purposes it supports. Not everything in Cub Scouting has to be serious – far from it! Silly songs, energetic games, and yummy snacks all have their place in the program.</p><p><a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/Parents/About/pandm.aspx">The Methods of Cub Scouting</a></p><p>To accomplish its purposes and achieve the overall goals of building character, learning citizenship, and developing personal fitness, Cub Scouting uses seven methods:</p><ol><li>Living the Ideals: Cub Scouting’s values are embedded in the Scout Oath, the Scout Law, the Cub Scout motto, and the Cub Scout sign, handshake, and salute. These practices help establish and reinforce the program’s values in boys and the leaders who guide them.</li><li>Belonging to a Den: The den—a group of six to eight boys who are about the same age—is the place where Cub Scouting starts. In the den, Cub Scouts develop new skills and interests, they practice sportsmanship and good citizenship, and they learn to do their best, not just for themselves but for the den as well.</li><li>Using Advancement: Recognition is important to boys. The advancement plan provides fun for the boys, gives them a sense of personal achievement as they earn badges, and strengthens family understanding as adult family members and their den leader work with boys on advancement projects.</li><li>Involving Family and Home: Whether a Cub Scout lives with two parents or one, a foster family, or other relatives, his family is an important part of Cub Scouting. Parents and adult family members provide leadership and support for Cub Scouting and help ensure that boys have a good experience in the program.</li><li>Participating in Activities: Cub Scouts participate in a huge array of activities, including games, projects, skits, stunts, songs, outdoor activities, trips and service projects. Besides being fun, these activities offer opportunities for growth, achievement, and family involvement.</li><li>Serving Home and Neighborhood: Cub Scouting focuses on the home and neighborhood. It helps boys strengthen connections to their local communities, which in turn support the boys’ growth and development.</li><li>Wearing the Uniform: Cub Scout uniforms serve a dual purpose, demonstrating membership in the group (everyone is dressed alike) and individual achievement (boys wear the badges they’ve earned). Wearing the uniform to meetings and activities also encourages a neat appearance, a sense of belonging, and good behavior.</li></ol><h3>Cub Scout Values and Character Development</h3><p>Since its origin, the Scouting program has been an educational experience concerned with values. In 1910, the first activities for Scouts were designed to build character, physical fitness, practical skills, and service. These elements were part of the original Cub Scout program and continue to be part of Cub Scouting today.</p><p><a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/Parents/About/CharacterDevelopment.aspx">Character development</a> should extend into every aspect of a boy’s life. Character development should also extend into every aspect of Cub Scouting. Cub Scout leaders should strive to use the 12 points of the Scout Law throughout all elements of the program—service projects, ceremonies, games, skits, songs, crafts, and all the other activities enjoyed at den and pack meetings.</p><h3>The Scout Law</h3><ul><li>A Scout is TRUSTWORTHY: A Scout tells the truth and keeps his promises. People can depend on him.</li><li>A Scout is LOYAL: A Scout is true to his family, friends, Scout leaders, school, and country.</li><li>A Scout is HELPFUL: A Scout volunteers to help others without expecting a reward.</li><li>A Scout is FRIENDLY: A Scout is a friend to everyone, even people who are very different from him.</li><li>A Scout is COURTEOUS: A Scout is polite to everyone and always uses good manners.</li><li>A Scout is KIND: A Scout treats others as he wants to be treated. He never harms or kills any living thing without good reason.</li><li>A Scout is OBEDIENT: A Scout follows the rules of his family, school, and pack. He obeys the laws of his community and country.</li><li>A Scout is CHEERFUL: A Scout looks for the bright side of life. He cheerfully does tasks that come his way. He tries to make others happy.</li><li>A Scout is THRIFTY: A Scout works to pay his way. He uses time, property, and natural resources wisely.</li><li>A Scout is BRAVE: A Scout can face danger even if he is afraid. He stands for what is right even if others laugh at him.</li><li>A Scout is CLEAN: A Scout keeps his body and mind fit. He helps keep his home and community clean.</li><li>A Scout is REVERENT: A Scout is reverent toward God. He is faithful in his religious duties. He respects the beliefs of others.</li></ul><p>Character can be defined as the collection of core values by an individual that leads to moral commitment and action.</p><p>Character development should challenge Cub Scouts to experience core values in six general areas: God, world, country, community, family, and self.</p><p>Character is “values in action.”</p><h3>Character Compass</h3><p>The goals of the Cub Scout leader are to seek out and maximize the many opportunities to incorporate character development to help the young Cub Scout understand that character is important to the individual, to his family, community, country, world, and God.</p><p>Character development should not be viewed as something done occasionally as part of a separate program, or as part of only one area of life. For in reality, character development is a part of everything a Cub Scout does. Character development lessons can be found in every aspect of the Cub Scouting experience.</p><picture>

In the den, Cub Scouts develop new skills and interests, they practice sportsmanship and good citizenship, and they learn to do their best, not just for themselves but for the den as well.</li><li>Using Advancement: Recognition is important to boys.

Parents and adult family members provide leadership and support for Cub Scouting and help ensure that boys have a good experience in the program.</li><li>Participating in Activities: Cub Scouts participate in a huge array of activities, including games, projects, skits, stunts, songs, outdoor activities, trips and service projects. Besides being fun, these activities offer opportunities for growth, achievement, and family involvement.</li><li>Serving Home and Neighborhood: Cub Scouting focuses on the home and neighborhood. It helps boys strengthen connections to their local communities, which in turn support the boys’ growth and development.</li><li>Wearing the Uniform: Cub Scout uniforms serve a dual purpose, demonstrating membership in the group (everyone is dressed alike) and individual achievement (boys wear the badges they’ve earned). Wearing the uniform to meetings and activities also encourages a neat appearance, a sense of belonging, and good behavior.</li></ol>","metadata":{"starred":true}},{"id":"9fe01b77-6942-4dd9-9b21-b9204963a754","item":"e8adcf74-18f6-47f8-b1f2-502bdcf30614","type":"h3","src":null,"created_at":"2016-08-19T14:12:41.754Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T14:25:41.738Z","_text":"Cub Scout Values and Character Development","_html":"<h3>Cub Scout Values and Character Development</h3>","metadata":{"starred":true}},{"id":"068b124a-1843-49d1-a10e-0c07f6c210d1","item":"e8adcf74-18f6-47f8-b1f2-502bdcf30614","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":"2016-08-19T14:12:41.754Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T14:25:41.738Z","_text":"Since its origin, the Scouting program has been an educational experience concerned with values.
