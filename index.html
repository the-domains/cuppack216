<h1><strong>Pack 216 FAQ</strong></h1><h2><strong>How does Cub Scouts work?</strong></h2><p>Pack 216 consists of boys in grades 1 through 5 from Lionville, Chester Springs, and surrounding areas. Most of our boys go to school at Lionville Elementary and Pickering Valley, but they can come from anywhere. The Pack is made up of different Dens. There’s a den for each grade. Each Den has a Den Leader and an Assistance Den Leader who is parent of one of the boys in the Den. The Den Leader will generally organize and run the Den meetings with the help from the other families in the Den.</p><h2><strong>When are the Meetings?</strong></h2><p>Each Den will work out its own schedule for their Den meetings. Generally, Dens will meet 2 times a month, but it really depends on the Den. The entire Pack (all the Dens together) meets once a month. Our Pack meetings are generally on the 3rd Thursday of every month starting at 6:45 pm until 8:30 pm at the latest.</p><p>There is also an Adult Committee Meeting on the 1st Thursday of every month. This is the time when the Committee Chair, the Cubmaster, the Den Leaders, and any interested parents plan the upcoming events.</p><h2><strong>Where are the Meetings?</strong></h2><p>The Dens figure out where to hold their Den meetings. Many Dens meet at St. Paul’s Lutheran Church: 104 Village Ave., Exton, PA 19342. The monthly Committee Meeting and Pack Meetings are at St. Paul’s.</p><h2><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></h2><p><strong>I</strong>n 2015-16 school year, scout dues were $40 for first time scouts and $50 for returning scouts. From this, $27 goes to BSA for dues and insurance. Other events like campouts and overnight sleep-ins have a nominal cost as set by the company providing the experience. For Pack camping in March and June, we try very hard to keep costs down so everyone can participate (including siblings).</p><h2><strong>What about fundraising?</strong></h2><p>Our Pack participates in the BSA Popcorn Sale to raise money for our Pack. The money helps to buy the awards the boys earn as well as subsidizing our camping trips. Selling popcorn is optional, but we try to incentivize the Scouts to sell. There are prizes for the top sellers as well as an opportunity to throw a pie in their parent’s face if they sell enough. The money raised from selling popcorn keeps our annual dues as low as possible.</p><h2><strong>Are Moms invite? What about Siblings?</strong></h2><p>Absolutely, Cub Scouting is a family program; we always welcome every parent’s participation at the meetings and the outings. We consider our Pack camping trips to be family camping. We have Moms and Dads, brothers and sisters of all ages at these events. Some events like Summer Camp are strictly for Cub Scouts and parents (including Moms).</p><h2><strong>What sort of uniform is required?</strong></h2><p>Boys will need a “Class A” uniform shirt. Boys in 1st - 3rd grade should have a blue Cub Scout uniform. Boy’s in 4th - 5th grade can have a blue shirt or they can opt for the tan color Boy Scout uniform. You should get a shirt that is large enough to last a few years. You should also get a Cub Scout belt. The belt will hold many of the awards the boys earn throughout the year. The Class A uniform shirt is what the boys should wear to the Pack meetings.</p><p>Patches to buy: World Scout Crest, Chester County Council Strip, Den Number</p><p>Provided by the Pack: Neckerchief and slide, Pack numerals, Cub Scout Handbook</p><p>Optional: Cub Scout hats, pants, socks. The Pack also sells a “Class B” t-shirt. This is a shirt we’ll ask the boys to wear if they are going to get dirty and sweaty so they don’t mess up their Class A uniform shirt. Class B t-shirts are also often worn to school.</p><h2><strong>Where can I get the uniform?</strong></h2><p>There are two Scout stores in the area:</p><ul><li>Chester County Council Store: 504 South Concord Rd., West Chester, PA 19382</li><li>Valley Forge Scout Store: 1485 Valley Forge Road, Wayne, PA 19087</li></ul><p>You may also be able to find uniforms at Kelly’s Sports in West Chester.</p><p>And finally, there is also an official online store: <a href="http://www.scoutstuff.org/">http://www.scoutstuff.org/</a></p><h2><strong>What are some of the events the Cub Scouts do?</strong></h2><ul><li>Our first Pack meeting in <strong>September</strong> has a carnival theme. The meeting is generally the 3rd Thursday in September at St. Paul’s Lutheran Church. The boys will be playing games at different stations while the adults have a chance to learn more about Cub Scouts.</li><li>In <strong>October</strong> we generally do a Hayride/cookout and a fall overnight camping trip.</li><li>In <strong>November</strong> we participate in Scouting for Food and donate collected food to the Lord’s Pantry in Downingtown. Our meeting also generally has Boy Scouts come to teach the Cub Scouts scouting skills like first aid, physical fitness, cooking, and knot tying. We also run a Space Derby.</li><li>In <strong>December</strong>, our Pack Meeting includes a cookie exchange and a winter scavenger hunt.</li><li>The <strong>January</strong> Pack Meeting has a toy auction which allows the boys an opportunity to get a gently used toy donated by another Scout and raise money for St. Paul’s (our Chartering Organization).</li><li><strong>February</strong> is the month we do our Pinewood Derby Race.</li><li>In <strong>March</strong> we go to Winter Camp at Camp Ware and the Blue and Gold Dinner. At this dinner, the Arrow of Light Scouts cross-over to Boy Scouts.</li><li>The <strong>April</strong> meeting typically presents a lot of awards and rank badges</li><li>Our <strong>May</strong> Pack Meeting is a cookout at the picnic area near the swimming pool at Marsh Creek State Park. Scouts are promoted to the next rank in a ceremony at this event.</li><li>In <strong>June</strong> we do family camping at Hibernia County Park (not a formal Pack Meeting). We also hold a model rocket launch at Church Farm School.</li></ul><h2><strong>Who are the Pack’s current leaders?</strong></h2><p><strong>Cubmaster</strong>: Scott Heath (sheath114@verizon.net).
