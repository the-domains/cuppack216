No matter what grade you are in, first through fifth, it can be a blast. Do you like to learn by doing? This is just the place. You can learn to tie knots, set up a tent, or shoot a bow and arrow (archery). Have you ever cooked a meal on a campfire? Sent a secret code to a buddy? Built a birdhouse? Hiked? Earn rewards for doing these things in Cub Scouts.</p><h3>Cub Scouts Belong to Packs and Dens</h3><p>As a Cub Scout, you will be part of your own pack.</p><p>The pack is divided into smaller groups called dens. Each den has about six to eight boys. All of the Cub Scouts in your den are in the same grade and may even go to the same school.</p><p>The Cub Scout pack belongs to a church, a school, or some other group of people in your community or neighborhood. This group makes sure your pack has good adult leaders, a place to meet, and exciting things to do. The group gets help from the Boy Scouts of America, which is part of Scouting around the world.</p><h3>Cub Scouts Do Things and Go Places</h3><p>Have you been to the local police station and talked to the policemen on duty? Or visited the fire station and sat in the driver’s seat of the pumper truck? Or visited the local TV station and sat in the news anchor’s chair? These are some of the places you might go with your den or pack.</p><p>You might also build a pinewood derby car and race it on the track, build a sailboat or trimaran and race it in the raingutter regatta, or build a spaceship and race it to the stars in the pack space derby.</p><h3>Cub Scouts Earn Awards</h3><p>Each time you complete an accomplishment or learn a new skill, you will be rewarded. Sometimes the reward is a loop for your belt, a pin, or a patch. Sometimes it is a smile on your parents’ faces to see you grow and learn.</p><p>Source: <a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/CubScouts/BeingACubScout/WhatIsCubScouting.aspx">What Is Cub Scouting</a></p><h2>What Do Scouts Do?</h2><p>Cub Scouts do fun things with other kids! They get to wear a cool uniform, go places, and see things. They play all kinds of sports and build things, like race cars and bird houses. Want to learn a secret code? Want to learn about wild animals? Go Cub Scouting!</p><p><a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/CubScouts.aspx">What Do Scouts Do</a></p><p>Cub Scouting is an active program. Boys learn by doing, and there’s no end to the fun things that Cub Scouts do in their dens, as a pack, and at special events. With activities held at every level—family, den, and pack—Cub Scouting provides a year-round program of fun and learning for boys and their families.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/Parents/Activities/camping.aspx">Cub Scout Camping</a>: Learn to live in the outdoors. Camping takes you on exciting adventures into the natural world.</li><li><a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/Parents/Activities/derbies.aspx">Cub Scout Derbies</a>: Racing in a Cub Scout derby is great fun. You’ll get to design your racing vehicle, work with a parent to build it, and see it perform on race day.</li><li><a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/Parents/Activities/excursions.aspx">Outings and Field Trips</a>: “Outing” is a big part of Scouting. Cub Scouts get out and about with many kinds of outdoor fun, such as field trips, hikes, nature and conservation.</li><li><a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/Parents/Activities/service.aspx">Service Projects</a>: Doing service projects together is one way that Cub Scouts keep their promise “to help other people.”</li><li><a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/Parents/Activities/meetings.aspx">Den and Pack Meetings</a>: Den meetings are the stepping-stones by which a boy progresses through the Cub Scout program. At pack meetings, families celebrate their achievements along the way.</li><li><a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/Parents/Activities/bgbanquet.aspx">Blue and Gold Banquets</a>: In February, when Scouting celebrates its “birthday,” packs across the country hold blue and gold banquets. In nearly all packs, the banquet is a very special event.</li></ul><h2>What Is The Scout Advancement Trail?</h2><p>On the advancement trail, a Cub Scout progresses from rank to rank, learning new skills as he goes.</p><h3>Bobcat</h3><p>No matter what age or grade a boy joins Cub Scouting, he must earn his Bobcat badge before he can advance to the rank of Tiger, Wolf, Bear, or Webelos.</p><h3>Tiger</h3><p>The Tiger rank is for boys who are in first grade or are age 7. To earn the Tiger badge, a boy must complete six required adventures with his den or family and one elective adventure of his den or family’s choosing. As the boy completes each adventure, he will receive the adventure loop for that adventure, which he can wear on his belt. When the boy has completed the seven required adventures, he can receive the Tiger badge.</p><h3>Wolf</h3><p>The Wolf rank is for boys who have finished first grade (or who are 8 years old). To earn the Wolf badge, a boy must complete six required adventures and one elective adventure. His parent or guardian and den leader approves each requirement by signing his book, and the boy receives an adventure loop for each adventure.</p><h3>Bear</h3><p>The Bear rank is for boys who have finished second grade (or who are 9 years old). To earn the Bear badge, a boy must complete six required adventures and one elective adventure. His parent or guardian and den leader approves each requirement by signing his book, and the boy receives an adventure loop for each adventure.</p><h3>Webelos</h3><p>Webelos dens are for boys who have completed third grade (or reached age 10). Webelos Scouts get to work on the five required Webelos adventures and choose two of the 18 elective adventures that are shared by the Webelos and Arrow of Light ranks.</p><p>When a boy has done the requirements for an adventure, the Webelos den leader, rather than a parent, approves most of the adventures. For each adventure a boy completes, he receives a pin to wear on the Webelos colors or on his hat. After completing seven adventures, including five required adventures and two elective adventures, a Scout can receive the Webelos badge.</p><h3>Arrow of Light</h3><p>The highest rank in Cub Scouting is the Arrow of Light. Earning this rank prepares a Webelos Scout to become a Boy Scout. Scouts must complete four required adventures and three elective adventures to earn the Arrow of Light rank. For each adventure a boy completes, he receives a pin to wear on the Webelos colors or on his hat.</p><p>More information:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/CubScouts/UniformsAndAwards/advancement.aspx">Advancement Trail</a></li><li><a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/CubScouts/UniformsAndAwards/sanda.aspx">Scouting Adventures</a></li></ul><h2>The Benefits of Scouting</h2><p>Scouting is unique. It is a movement dedicated to bringing out the best in people. Cub Scouting doesn’t emphasize winning as an end result, but rather the far more demanding task of doing one’s best.</p><p>Scouting helps nurture courage and kindness and allows boys to play, to laugh, to develop their imaginations, and to express their feelings. We want boys to become useful and stable individuals who are aware of their own potential. Helping a boy to learn the value of his own worth is the greatest gift we can give him.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/Parents/About/benefits.aspx">Benefits to Scouting</a> are numerous:</p><ul><li>Cub Scouting Is Fun</li><li>Cub Scouting Has Ideals</li><li>Cub Scouting Strengthens Families</li><li>Cub Scouting Helps Boys Develop Interests and Skills</li><li>Cub Scouting Provides Adventure</li><li>Cub Scouting Has an Advancement Plan</li><li>Cub Scouting Creates Fellowship</li><li>Cub Scouting Promotes Diversity</li><li>Cub Scouting Provides a Year-Round Program</li><li>Cub Scouting Is a Positive Place</li></ul><h2>The Cub Scouting Method</h2><p>The Cub Scouting program has 10 purposes related to the overall mission of the Boy Scouts of America – to build character, learn citizenship, and develop personal fitness:</p><ol><li>Character Development</li><li>Spiritual Growth</li><li>Good Citizenship</li><li>Sportsmanship and Fitness</li><li>Family Understanding</li><li>Respectful Relationships</li><li>Personal Achievement</li><li>Friendly Service</li><li>Fun and Adventure</li><li>Preparation for Boy Scouts</li></ol><p>Every Cub Scouting activity should help fulfill one of these purposes. When considering a new activity, ask which purpose or purposes it supports. Not everything in Cub Scouting has to be serious – far from it! Silly songs, energetic games, and yummy snacks all have their place in the program.</p><p><a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/Parents/About/pandm.aspx">The Methods of Cub Scouting</a></p><p>To accomplish its purposes and achieve the overall goals of building character, learning citizenship, and developing personal fitness, Cub Scouting uses seven methods:</p><ol><li>Living the Ideals: Cub Scouting’s values are embedded in the Scout Oath, the Scout Law, the Cub Scout motto, and the Cub Scout sign, handshake, and salute. These practices help establish and reinforce the program’s values in boys and the leaders who guide them.</li><li>Belonging to a Den: The den—a group of six to eight boys who are about the same age—is the place where Cub Scouting starts. In the den, Cub Scouts develop new skills and interests, they practice sportsmanship and good citizenship, and they learn to do their best, not just for themselves but for the den as well.</li><li>Using Advancement: Recognition is important to boys. The advancement plan provides fun for the boys, gives them a sense of personal achievement as they earn badges, and strengthens family understanding as adult family members and their den leader work with boys on advancement projects.</li><li>Involving Family and Home: Whether a Cub Scout lives with two parents or one, a foster family, or other relatives, his family is an important part of Cub Scouting. Parents and adult family members provide leadership and support for Cub Scouting and help ensure that boys have a good experience in the program.</li><li>Participating in Activities: Cub Scouts participate in a huge array of activities, including games, projects, skits, stunts, songs, outdoor activities, trips and service projects. Besides being fun, these activities offer opportunities for growth, achievement, and family involvement.</li><li>Serving Home and Neighborhood: Cub Scouting focuses on the home and neighborhood. It helps boys strengthen connections to their local communities, which in turn support the boys’ growth and development.</li><li>Wearing the Uniform: Cub Scout uniforms serve a dual purpose, demonstrating membership in the group (everyone is dressed alike) and individual achievement (boys wear the badges they’ve earned). Wearing the uniform to meetings and activities also encourages a neat appearance, a sense of belonging, and good behavior.</li></ol><h3>Cub Scout Values and Character Development</h3><p>Since its origin, the Scouting program has been an educational experience concerned with values. In 1910, the first activities for Scouts were designed to build character, physical fitness, practical skills, and service. These elements were part of the original Cub Scout program and continue to be part of Cub Scouting today.</p><p><a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/Parents/About/CharacterDevelopment.aspx">Character development</a> should extend into every aspect of a boy’s life. Character development should also extend into every aspect of Cub Scouting. Cub Scout leaders should strive to use the 12 points of the Scout Law throughout all elements of the program—service projects, ceremonies, games, skits, songs, crafts, and all the other activities enjoyed at den and pack meetings.</p><h3>The Scout Law</h3><ul><li>A Scout is TRUSTWORTHY: A Scout tells the truth and keeps his promises. People can depend on him.</li><li>A Scout is LOYAL: A Scout is true to his family, friends, Scout leaders, school, and country.</li><li>A Scout is HELPFUL: A Scout volunteers to help others without expecting a reward.</li><li>A Scout is FRIENDLY: A Scout is a friend to everyone, even people who are very different from him.</li><li>A Scout is COURTEOUS: A Scout is polite to everyone and always uses good manners.</li><li>A Scout is KIND: A Scout treats others as he wants to be treated. He never harms or kills any living thing without good reason.</li><li>A Scout is OBEDIENT: A Scout follows the rules of his family, school, and pack. He obeys the laws of his community and country.</li><li>A Scout is CHEERFUL: A Scout looks for the bright side of life. He cheerfully does tasks that come his way. He tries to make others happy.</li><li>A Scout is THRIFTY: A Scout works to pay his way. He uses time, property, and natural resources wisely.</li><li>A Scout is BRAVE: A Scout can face danger even if he is afraid. He stands for what is right even if others laugh at him.</li><li>A Scout is CLEAN: A Scout keeps his body and mind fit. He helps keep his home and community clean.</li><li>A Scout is REVERENT: A Scout is reverent toward God. He is faithful in his religious duties. He respects the beliefs of others.</li></ul><p>Character can be defined as the collection of core values by an individual that leads to moral commitment and action.</p><p>Character development should challenge Cub Scouts to experience core values in six general areas: God, world, country, community, family, and self.</p><p>Character is “values in action.”</p><h3>Character Compass</h3><p>The goals of the Cub Scout leader are to seek out and maximize the many opportunities to incorporate character development to help the young Cub Scout understand that character is important to the individual, to his family, community, country, world, and God.</p><p>Character development should not be viewed as something done occasionally as part of a separate program, or as part of only one area of life. For in reality, character development is a part of everything a Cub Scout does.

<h1><strong>Pack 216 FAQ</strong></h1><h2><strong>How does Cub Scouts work?</strong></h2><p>Pack 216 consists of boys in grades 1 through 5 from Lionville, Chester Springs, and surrounding areas. Most of our boys go to school at Lionville Elementary and Pickering Valley, but they can come from anywhere. The Pack is made up of different Dens. There’s a den for each grade. Each Den has a Den Leader and an Assistance Den Leader who is parent of one of the boys in the Den. The Den Leader will generally organize and run the Den meetings with the help from the other families in the Den.</p><h2><strong>When are the Meetings?</strong></h2><p>Each Den will work out its own schedule for their Den meetings. Generally, Dens will meet 2 times a month, but it really depends on the Den. The entire Pack (all the Dens together) meets once a month. Our Pack meetings are generally on the 3rd Thursday of every month starting at 6:45 pm until 8:30 pm at the latest.</p><p>There is also an Adult Committee Meeting on the 1st Thursday of every month. This is the time when the Committee Chair, the Cubmaster, the Den Leaders, and any interested parents plan the upcoming events.</p><h2><strong>Where are the Meetings?</strong></h2><p>The Dens figure out where to hold their Den meetings. Many Dens meet at St. Paul’s Lutheran Church: 104 Village Ave., Exton, PA 19342. The monthly Committee Meeting and Pack Meetings are at St. Paul’s.</p><h2><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></h2><p><strong>I</strong>n 2015-16 school year, scout dues were $40 for first time scouts and $50 for returning scouts. From this, $27 goes to BSA for dues and insurance. Other events like campouts and overnight sleep-ins have a nominal cost as set by the company providing the experience. For Pack camping in March and June, we try very hard to keep costs down so everyone can participate (including siblings).</p><h2><strong>What about fundraising?</strong></h2><p>Our Pack participates in the BSA Popcorn Sale to raise money for our Pack. The money helps to buy the awards the boys earn as well as subsidizing our camping trips. Selling popcorn is optional, but we try to incentivize the Scouts to sell. There are prizes for the top sellers as well as an opportunity to throw a pie in their parent’s face if they sell enough. The money raised from selling popcorn keeps our annual dues as low as possible.</p><h2><strong>Are Moms invite? What about Siblings?</strong></h2><p>Absolutely, Cub Scouting is a family program; we always welcome every parent’s participation at the meetings and the outings. We consider our Pack camping trips to be family camping. We have Moms and Dads, brothers and sisters of all ages at these events. Some events like Summer Camp are strictly for Cub Scouts and parents (including Moms).</p><h2><strong>What sort of uniform is required?</strong></h2><p>Boys will need a “Class A” uniform shirt. Boys in 1st - 3rd grade should have a blue Cub Scout uniform. Boy’s in 4th - 5th grade can have a blue shirt or they can opt for the tan color Boy Scout uniform. You should get a shirt that is large enough to last a few years. You should also get a Cub Scout belt. The belt will hold many of the awards the boys earn throughout the year. The Class A uniform shirt is what the boys should wear to the Pack meetings.</p><p>Patches to buy: World Scout Crest, Chester County Council Strip, Den Number</p><p>Provided by the Pack: Neckerchief and slide, Pack numerals, Cub Scout Handbook</p><p>Optional: Cub Scout hats, pants, socks. The Pack also sells a “Class B” t-shirt. This is a shirt we’ll ask the boys to wear if they are going to get dirty and sweaty so they don’t mess up their Class A uniform shirt. Class B t-shirts are also often worn to school.</p><h2><strong>Where can I get the uniform?</strong></h2><p>There are two Scout stores in the area:</p><ul><li>Chester County Council Store: 504 South Concord Rd., West Chester, PA 19382</li><li>Valley Forge Scout Store: 1485 Valley Forge Road, Wayne, PA 19087</li></ul><p>You may also be able to find uniforms at Kelly’s Sports in West Chester.</p><p>And finally, there is also an official online store: <a href="http://www.scoutstuff.org/">http://www.scoutstuff.org/</a></p><h2><strong>What are some of the events the Cub Scouts do?</strong></h2><ul><li>Our first Pack meeting in <strong>September</strong> has a carnival theme. The meeting is generally the 3rd Thursday in September at St. Paul’s Lutheran Church. The boys will be playing games at different stations while the adults have a chance to learn more about Cub Scouts.</li><li>In <strong>October</strong> we generally do a Hayride/cookout and a fall overnight camping trip.</li><li>In <strong>November</strong> we participate in Scouting for Food and donate collected food to the Lord’s Pantry in Downingtown. Our meeting also generally has Boy Scouts come to teach the Cub Scouts scouting skills like first aid, physical fitness, cooking, and knot tying. We also run a Space Derby.</li><li>In <strong>December</strong>, our Pack Meeting includes a cookie exchange and a winter scavenger hunt.</li><li>The <strong>January</strong> Pack Meeting has a toy auction which allows the boys an opportunity to get a gently used toy donated by another Scout and raise money for St. Paul’s (our Chartering Organization).</li><li><strong>February</strong> is the month we do our Pinewood Derby Race.</li><li>In <strong>March</strong> we go to Winter Camp at Camp Ware and the Blue and Gold Dinner. At this dinner, the Arrow of Light Scouts cross-over to Boy Scouts.</li><li>The <strong>April</strong> meeting typically presents a lot of awards and rank badges</li><li>Our <strong>May</strong> Pack Meeting is a cookout at the picnic area near the swimming pool at Marsh Creek State Park. Scouts are promoted to the next rank in a ceremony at this event.</li><li>In <strong>June</strong> we do family camping at Hibernia County Park (not a formal Pack Meeting). We also hold a model rocket launch at Church Farm School.</li></ul><h2><strong>Who are the Pack’s current leaders?</strong></h2><p><strong>Cubmaster</strong>: Scott Heath (sheath114@verizon.net).

These practices help establish and reinforce the program’s values in boys and the leaders who guide them.</li><li>Belonging to a Den: The den—a group of six to eight boys who are about the same age—is the place where Cub Scouting starts. In the den, Cub Scouts develop new skills and interests, they practice sportsmanship and good citizenship, and they learn to do their best, not just for themselves but for the den as well.</li><li>Using Advancement: Recognition is important to boys. The advancement plan provides fun for the boys, gives them a sense of personal achievement as they earn badges, and strengthens family understanding as adult family members and their den leader work with boys on advancement projects.</li><li>Involving Family and Home: Whether a Cub Scout lives with two parents or one, a foster family, or other relatives, his family is an important part of Cub Scouting. Parents and adult family members provide leadership and support for Cub Scouting and help ensure that boys have a good experience in the program.</li><li>Participating in Activities: Cub Scouts participate in a huge array of activities, including games, projects, skits, stunts, songs, outdoor activities, trips and service projects. Besides being fun, these activities offer opportunities for growth, achievement, and family involvement.</li><li>Serving Home and Neighborhood: Cub Scouting focuses on the home and neighborhood. It helps boys strengthen connections to their local communities, which in turn support the boys’ growth and development.</li><li>Wearing the Uniform: Cub Scout uniforms serve a dual purpose, demonstrating membership in the group (everyone is dressed alike) and individual achievement (boys wear the badges they’ve earned). Wearing the uniform to meetings and activities also encourages a neat appearance, a sense of belonging, and good behavior.</li></ol>","src":null,"created_at":"2016-08-19T14:06:10.757Z","updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true}},{"id":"4f982817-2668-4396-9d48-db68d7f401a4","item":"e8adcf74-18f6-47f8-b1f2-502bdcf30614","type":"h3","html":"<h3>Cub Scout Values and Character Development</h3>","src":null,"created_at":"2016-08-19T14:06:10.757Z","updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true},"text":"Cub Scout Values and Character Development"},{"id":"03231268-1e38-4b2e-830a-ea6adee47082","item":"e8adcf74-18f6-47f8-b1f2-502bdcf30614","type":"text","html":"<p>Since its origin, the Scouting program has been an educational experience concerned with values.
